# Fea-DA---Uknown-SAR-Target-Identification-Method
This is a novel unknown sar target identification method based on feature extraction networks and KLD-RPA joint discrimination. Experiment results form MSTAR dataset shows that our proposed Fea-DA achieves state of the art unknown sar target identification accuracy while maintaining the high recognition accuracy of known target.
